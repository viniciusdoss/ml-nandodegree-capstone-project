# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Capstone Project

#### Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Capstone Project

## Problem Statement
  In the financial context of credit card transactions, we are often faced with customers who are charged with paying for items that they have not actually purchased. We call this fraudulent credit card transactions. In order to avoid such a problem, it is important that companies are able to identify / recognize when a credit card transaction is a fraud or not.
	The purpose of this project is to create a classifier model that is able to recognize fraudulent transactions using machine learning. The dataset  used in this experiment has transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
  The question we want to answer is whether a credit card transaction is considered fraudulent or not. In other words, we have a dataset available with information on credit card transactions already labeled as fraudulent or not and, based on them, we want to train a machine learning model to identify whether new transactions are fraudulent.
  The aim of the project is to put into practice the machine learning engineering knowledge that was learned during the process of studying in machine learning engineering nanodegree program at Udacity.
